# 💳 Loan Prediction

## Project Description

Loan Prediction is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on an applicant's personal, financial, and credit-related information.

The application uses a trained Machine Learning model to analyze various applicant attributes and instantly determine the loan approval status through a simple and user-friendly web interface.

# ML Flow

1. Collect the loan prediction dataset.
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Encode categorical features.
4. Scale numerical features.
5. Train the Machine Learning model.
6. Save the trained model and preprocessing objects using Pickle.
7. Load the model into the Flask application.
8. User enters applicant details.
9. Model predicts whether the loan is likely to be Approved or Rejected.
10. Display the prediction on the result page.
